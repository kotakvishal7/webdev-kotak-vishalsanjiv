Hi,

I am Vishal Sanjiv Kotak, currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai with the concentration in Database Management Systems and Mobile Application Development.

I have worked professionally for one and half years, firstly with Accenture Services Private Limited as a Systems Application Programming in Data Processing (SAP) - Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) and secondly, with TSS Consultancy Private Limited as a Software Developer. I got exposed to Single Page Web Applications (SPA) during my tenure and got a chance to create a scalable web application for one of the largest banks in the world.

These skills intrigued me and motivated me to pursue a career in web application development. I am taking this course to learn new skills to be a better web developer.

Please refer the below points for some of the projects I have worked on:

**1. Diabetic Patient Readmission Application**
- Created algorithms using Java to predict Diabetic patient readmission after being discharged from the hospital by exploring a real-world dataset which presents ten years (1999 - 2008) of clinical care data at one hundred and thirty US Hospitals
- This repository is mainly focussed on showcasing my knowledge and skills learned in the course of Web Development at Northeastern University with help of Assignments and Projects.

**2. Media Licensing Lab**
- Developed a web platform using Java Spring - MVC, Angular.js, and MySQL for artists to collaborate, share compositions with followers and get their creations copyrighted

## Assignment 4

This assignment focuses on creating Web services with the Express Node.js module. Web services will expose server side data sources through HTTP endpoints. The angular services will access the data from the Web services through various HTTP requests such as POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.

# AngularFourMEANSeed

After you clone this repository and run "npm install"
To start the project
Open two terminals, One to start the front end, One to start the backend

~ npm start


~ nodemon server.js

Front end will run on `http://localhost:4200/`
Server will run on port 3100. Specified in server.js and in environment.ts files







## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
